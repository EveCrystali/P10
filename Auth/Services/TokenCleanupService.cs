        The issue is that the Dispose method in the TokenCleanupService class 
        does not call GC.SuppressFinalize(this). This is a good practice when 
        implementing the IDisposable interface.

        GC.SuppressFinalize(this) is used to prevent the garbage collector from 
        calling the finalizer (also known as the destructor) of the object. 
        When an object implements IDisposable, it's likely that it has some 
        unmanaged resources that need to be cleaned up, and the finalizer is 
        not necessary.

        By calling GC.SuppressFinalize(this), you're telling the garbage 
        collector that the object has already been properly cleaned up and 
        there's no need to call the finalizer. This can improve performance 
        and prevent potential issues.
